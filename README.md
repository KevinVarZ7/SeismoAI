# SeismoAI
Deep Learning applications to seismological analysis: earthquake detection and phase classification. Early stages on CNN and RNN developments in order to analyze a wide variety of seismological data, such as, local seismic activity at Mexico Valley, seismic swarms related to volcanic activity in the Michoac√°n Volcanic Complex and DAS-CDMX project.

This repository contains: 
- synthetic computations of PS wave progapagation in layered geological media, for 2D and 3D cases, based on Indirect Boundary Element Method.
- Preprocessing modules for seismic signals
- Real data analysis with different deep learning approaches like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Applications to seismo-volcanic single-component time series for binary classification, wave phase picking under a multiclassification scheme.
